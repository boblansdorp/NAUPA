# NAUPA File
The California state has partnered with a private entity to generate NAUPA files. This project is an attempt to overcome the paywalls to be able to generate a NAUPA file at no cost.

# Quick start
place the naupaGenerator.exe file in the same folder as an .xlsx file. Running the exe file will read the .xlsx file and create an output.txt file. This output.txt file is a NAUPA file.

## Installation
Visual Studio
Install go

### Getting up and running
run: `go run main.go` and it will scan main directory for a .xlsx file to import

## File details
### Open an excel file template
### Generating a NAUAPA File
### Test functions

### Real world testing
The California reporting portal will give an error report if a NAUPA file doesn't meet spec. https://hrp.sco.ca.gov/Reporting/CreateReport
It's easier to use this than develop a custom testing routine!
